## Enhancements implemented
1. Implemented a feature allowing users to add temporary lessons, which includes
    - creating a UI representation of a lesson
    - creating the relevant models for a lesson and the abstraction of a list of lessons
    - adding logic to handle the parsing of the command
2. Added logic to check for any conflicts between temporary lessons
   - to prevent a user from adding a lesson that clashes with one that he/she already has. 
3. Added persistence for lessons added, which includes
   - creating the `JSON` representations of the relevant models
